They are massive in composition, the details of their appearance are subtly articulated. They sit in a pool that is dry but has a drain. The artist was the zoo's director. The piece was constructed with the intention of its being a \"play sculpture\" for children. From a 1974 memo: \"...the fountain will have several inches of water in it. The children of Honolulu could have a joyous time playing in the water and climbing on the hippos, whose surfaces would be made smooth, resin-coated Belonza quartz.\" Located at the Honolulu Zoo.",

The tall stone represents Korea; the smaller stone, in the shape of Diamond Head, symbolizes the United States, specifically Hawaii. The greenish bronze element adjacent to the tall stone conveys the crooked backs of laborers and the tools of plantation workers. The other greenish bronze element represents the prow of an immigrant ship and the high hopes for the future. The small angular stones depict the Hawaiian islands. The embedded white stones represent the more than 7,000 early Korean immigrants to the United States. The circular perimeter provides a sense of harmony and conveys the friendship between Korea and the United States. Located at Pawaa Inha Neighborhood Park.",
