# ART&FACT: 

ART&FACT, for artifacts and the 'art & facts' behind each piece.  

An app made to promote the arts and to encourage folks to explore their city.  
The idea revolves around geocached 'tour guide' stories for public artworks, unlocked by user proximity. To see each artwork's hidden stories, one must actually visit the artwork and be within 50 meters to read it!

I scraped the 2012 State of Hawaii's Public Art Database, and updated some of the missing fields. See the `/data` folder for more details.
