# ART&FACT: 

An app made to promote the arts and to encourage folks to explore their city.  
The idea revolves around geocached 'tour guide' stories for public artworks, unlocked by user proximity.  

I scraped the 2012 State of Hawaii's Public Art Database, and updated some of the missing fields. See the /data folder for more details.
